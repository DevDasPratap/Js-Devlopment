IP: internet protocol
ipv4, ipv6

ip is network layer protocol

design was based on following assumption
 - ip should provide an unreliable connectionless server
 - must have fixed 32 bit address // like: x.y.z.w  x=8bit, y=8bit, z=8bit, w=8bit,
 - ip hosts should be able to exchange variable

why ip came up?
what is the address assiginment?
