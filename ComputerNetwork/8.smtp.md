how smtp works?
when an email is sent, it is sent to the senders smtp server using smtp protocol
also the smtp server is configured in the mail client only

the smtp server places the email on a message queue
then smtp server initiate a connection with reciver smtp server and conducts and initial smtp handshake
then finally it sends the emails to recipient smtp server
the email is downloaded from reciver smtp server and then client showes the mail.

smtp is actually (sent email) push protocol
in order to download email (getting the email from server) pop3/imap these are pull protocol

if recientant smtp server is offline, the sender smtp server tries again and again after some delta minutes
there is a set throshold after which it stops sending the email and marks its not deliver
