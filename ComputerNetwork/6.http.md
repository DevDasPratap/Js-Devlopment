HTTP

it standars for hyper text transfer protocol

objects: web pages are the main object that contain other object can be mp3 file, png,jpg file

curry object has a url

URL: protocol + hostname+location of file + extra argument
example: http://example.com/images/image.jpg

it define the whole procedure on how client and server will intract

so a lot of application layer protocols depend on lower level protocols of transport layer

in transport layer there are 2 main protocols
 - TCP
 - UDP

TCP: http depends on tcp
when we make any http call first establish tcp connection, over the tcp we call http

there 2 types of http connection also
 - persistance http connection
 - non persistance http connection
