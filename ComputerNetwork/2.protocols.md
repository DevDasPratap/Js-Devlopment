protocol: a protocol are set of rules and regulation setup a communicate and share information over a network
ex: http, udp, tcp, smtp
packets: in order to share data we cant send big chunk of data over the network, so we devide the data in smaller chunks, these small chunks are called as packets

address: sending messages over the networks requires the destination detail uniquly identify the end system is called as address.

ports: any machine could be running many network apps. in order to distingush these apps for reciving messages use are ports. (formally we called port number)

socket: ip address + port

port helps you get the packets to specific process on the host

more about port: every process has 16 bit port number (range from 0 - 2^16 = 65535)
port: 0-1023 -> well known ports
like 80->http, 443->https it are reserved ports

port: 1024 - 41952 -> register ports
they are used by specific, potentially propritary apps/process that are know but system defined
