const cors = require ('cors')

Corss-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header
based machanism that allows a server to indicate any origins
(Domain, Scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser
should permit loading resources.

const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'http://your-angular-app-domain.com', // Replace with your Angular app's domain
  methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE',
  credentials: true, // If you need to handle cookies or authentication
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));


How does CORS work?
Let's first see what is CORS preflight mechanism.
preflight mechanism: It is a part of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) standard that is used to check if
a cross-origin request is safe to send before actually sending it. This is done to prevent certain types of attacks,
such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which can occur when a web page
can make requests to a different domain that the user did not intendg
CORS preflight call: It is a special type of HTTP OPTIONS request that a browser sends to a server to check
whether the server will allow a subsequent cross-origin request. It includes information about the origin, the
request method, and headersg
Now let's see how CORS works
Let's say you have a website hosted on examplescom and you want to make a request to an ,PI located on
apisexamplesorgr
+ website on "example.com" makes a request to the ,PI on apisexamplesorg
+ Before the actual request is sent, the browser sends a preflight request to the server hosting the ,PI
("api.example.org"). This preflight request is an HTTP OPTIONS request that asks the server whether it will
allow the actual requestf
+ The server hosting the ,PI responds to the preflight request with a set of headers that indicate whether the

request is allowed or not. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-
Methods, and Access-Control-Allow-Headers

+ If the server responds with headers that allow the request, the browser sends the actual request to the ,PI
and retrieves the requested datag
