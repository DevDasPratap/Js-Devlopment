## **DevOps Roadmap for a JavaScript Developer**

### **DevOps Concepts**
1. **DevOps** - Development & Operations, a methodology for automating and integrating the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
2. **DevOps Life Cycle** - Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor.
3. **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** - Process for planning, developing, testing, and deploying software.
4. **Agile** - An iterative software development approach for faster releases and flexibility.

### **Operating System & Scripting**
5. **Linux** - Open-source OS for server management and DevOps automation.
6. **Shell Scripting** - Automates Linux commands and tasks via scripts.

### **Build & Source Code Management**
7. **Webpack** - A module bundler for JavaScript applications, optimizing assets and dependencies.
8. **Git** - Distributed version control system for tracking code changes.

### **CI/CD & Automation Tools**
9. **Jenkins** - Open-source automation server for CI/CD pipelines.
10. **Ansible** - Configuration management and automation tool for infrastructure provisioning.
11. **Nexus** - Artifact repository manager for storing and distributing dependencies.

### **Containerization & Orchestration**
12. **Docker** - Platform for packaging applications into portable containers.
13. **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration tool for managing and scaling containerized apps.

### **Monitoring & Logging**
14. **Grafana** - Monitoring and visualization tool for time-series data.
15. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** - Centralized logging and analysis platform.

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
16. **Terraform** - Automates infrastructure provisioning using configuration files.

## **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** - Scalable virtual servers in the cloud.
2. **AZ (Availability Zones)** - AWS data centers for high availability.
3. **AM (Amazon Machine Image)** - Pre-configured server images for EC2.
4. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** - Manages AWS user permissions and roles.
5. **Network & Security** - Manages AWS security groups, firewalls, and encryption.
6. **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** - Persistent block storage for EC2.
7. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** - Isolated network within AWS for managing resources.
8. **ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)** - Distributes traffic among multiple EC2 instances.
9. **Route 53** - Scalable domain name system (DNS) for routing web traffic.
10. **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging service for AWS resources.
11. **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as code service for provisioning AWS resources.
12. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** - Scalable object storage for files and backups.
13. **SQS (Simple Queue Service)** - Message queuing service for decoupling microservices.
14. **Lambda** - Serverless compute service for running event-driven code.
15. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** - Messaging service for sending alerts and notifications.
16. **Elastic Beanstalk** - PaaS for easy deployment of applications in AWS.
