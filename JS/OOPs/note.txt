Functional Programming alernate of OOPs



OOPs structed in Programming
1. Classes
2. Objects
3. Properties
4. Methods


Four principle for OOPs
1. Abstraction: Hide something for simplisity
2. Encapsulation: Keep Properties and method private. that will not work outside of the class
3. Inheritance: Child class will take matching Properties and values from parent class
4. Polymorphism: This will behave many ways.a child class can overwrite a method that inherited from parent class
