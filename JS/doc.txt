🚀 **JavaScript Knowledge Nuggets - Uncover Key Concepts!**

Let's explore some essential JavaScript topics:

48. 📦 **Higher Order Component (HOC):** It's a function that takes a component and returns a new component, often used for code reuse and logic sharing in React.

51. 🌐 **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** SSR is a technique to render web pages on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client. Pros include SEO benefits, but cons include increased server load.

53. 🧐 **WeakSet and WeakMap:** Data structures in JavaScript that allow you to store weak references to objects, which can be useful for managing memory.

59. 📜 **Array-Like Objects:** Objects that resemble arrays but lack array methods. Common examples include the `arguments` object and DOM collections.

60. 🚦 **Non-Strict Mode:** Used in JavaScript to disable certain error-prone features. Useful in scenarios where you want to catch potential issues.

61. 📦 **Publishing an NPM Package:** Steps to share your code with the world. It involves creating a package.json file and using the `npm publish` command.

62. 🌟 **Promise:** A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. `Promise.all()` resolves a bunch of promises in order.

63. 🏭 **Factory Pattern:** A creational design pattern used for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

64. 📚 **ES6 Class vs. ES5 Implementation:** Comparing the modern class syntax with the traditional constructor function approach in JavaScript.

65. 🎨 **Decorator Pattern:** A structural design pattern that allows you to add new behaviors to objects dynamically without altering their code.

67. ⏲️ **`setTimeout` vs. `setInterval`:** Understanding the differences in how these functions handle timing and repetition in JavaScript.

69. 🎭 **Proxy Pattern:** A behavioral design pattern that provides an object to control access to another object.

70. 🕊️ **Observer Pattern:** A behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of changes.
