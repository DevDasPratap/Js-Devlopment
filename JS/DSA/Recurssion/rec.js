/**
 * Here are some tips to help you become proficient in using recursion:
 * 
 * Clear Out Your Basics:
 * Start with a solid understanding of recursion and how it works,
 * understand how a function calls itself to solve a problem in smaller, similar instances.
 * 
 * Identify Base Cases:
 * Every recursive function should have one or more base cases, which
 * are the simplest scenarios that can be solved directly, itâ€™s Important
 * to prevent infinite recursion.
 * 
 * Create the Recursive Case:
 * For non-base cases, define how the problem can be broken down
 * into smaller, similar subproblems. This is the recursive case, and it
 * should eventually lead to the base case.
 * 
 * Visualize Recursion:
 * Use visualization techniques, such as recursion trees or stack
 * diagrams, to understand the flow of recursive function calls and how
 * they build up and resolve.
 * 
 * Test and Debug:
 * Test your recursive functions with various inputs to ensure they work 
 * correctly. Be prepared for stack overflow errors in case of incorrect 
 * base cases or excessive recursion.
 * 
 * Maintain State:
 * Ensure that the state of your program is maintained correctly across 
 * recursive calls. This includes variables, data structures, and other 
 * information necessary to solve the problem.
 * 
 * Use Helper Functions:
 * In some cases, it may be helpful to create a helper function within 
 * your recursive function to encapsulate the recursion logic and pass 
 * additional parameters if needed.
 * 
 * Practice, Practice, Practice:
 * Recursion can be challenging, so practice is essential. Work on a 
 * variety of problems that can be solved using recursion to gain 
 * experience and confidence.
 * 
 * Learn from Examples:
 * Study and understand examples of recursive algorithms and 
 * functions, such as those for calculating factorials, Fibonacci 
 * advanced data structures and algorithms, such as merge sort, 
 * quicksort, and tree traversal, rely on recursion.
 * 
 * Avoid Excessive Recursion:
 * While recursion is elegant, it may not always be the most efficient 
 * solution. In some cases, iterative approaches may be better for 
 * performance reasons.
