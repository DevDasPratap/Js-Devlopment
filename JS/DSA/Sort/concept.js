/**
 * Stability in sorting algorithm
 * Example: stable short is: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort
 * Example: unstable sort: Selection sort, quick sort, heap sort
 */

// In-Place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. 
// In-Place Sorting:
// Insertion Sort
// Selection Sort
// Bubble Sort
/**
 * Stability in Sorting Algorithm
 * What is a stable sorting algorithm? 
 * Where stable sorting algorithms are useful?
 * Which sorting algorithms are stable? 
 *  - Some Sorting Algorithms are stable by nature, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort, etc. Comparison-based stable sorts such as Merge Sort and Insertion Sort maintain stability
 * Which sorting algorithms are unstable?
 * Can we make any sorting algorithm stable?
