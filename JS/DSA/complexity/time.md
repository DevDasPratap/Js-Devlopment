Amount of time taken as the function of input size

Amount of time taken - opearation
(a+b), i->10x, 1-> 10

comapany 
1 - employee - remember in my mind
10 - employee - store in copy
10000 - employee - need system to store and manage

complexity representation

weight -> kg
distance - km/meter
ligiud -> liter

same for time complexity

big 0 -> uper bound/worst case
thetha 0 -> avg bound
omega -> lower bound

type
- constant o(1), where n has defined like n=10, n> 10, n<10
- liner time complexity O(n), where n is not defined
- quardic - O(n2)
for(1-n){
    for(1-n){

    }
}

- O(n3)

- logarithm O(logn) - n=500 -> n=250 -> n=125

- exponential 2n, 3n

- n!

n(logn)
for(n){
    while(){}
}

O(n) paraller run
