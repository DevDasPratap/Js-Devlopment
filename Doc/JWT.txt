APIs are the backbone of modern web and mobile applications, allowing different software components to communicate with each other.

But like any valuable asset, APIs need to be properly secured. One popular approach for API security is JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

In this post, I'll explain JWTs in simple terms to help you protect your APIs.

Imagine your APIs are like a nightclub.

The bouncer (authentication server) needs to allow in valid patrons (users/clients) but keep out shady characters (attackers/unauthorized access).

With JWT auth, when a patron arrives the bouncer gives them a wristband (JWT) after checking their ID. The wristband has the patron's name, VIP status, age, etc encoded into it.

Whenever the patron wants to enter a restricted area like the VIP lounge, they show their wristband to the staff.

The staff decode the wristband to validate the patron's access rights.

The wristband also has an expiration time, forcing the patron to occasionally re-verify with the bouncer.

JWTs work similarly - they are encoded JSON objects that assert user identity and privileges.

They contain a header (algorithm used), payload (user data/claims), and signature (to prevent tampering).

The signature is created with a secret key only your API knows.

When a client calls your API, your authentication server generates a JWT with the user's identity and privileges and sends it back.

The client stores this JWT and sends it in the authorization header for every subsequent request.

Your API verifies the JWT signature with the secret key to authenticate the user.

JWT advantages:

- Compact: Can store lots of user data in compact JSON format
- Self-contained: No need to query the database for each request
- Secure: Signed with secret key to prevent tampering

So remember, JWTs are like VIP wristbands for your APIs, allowing verified access without excessive queries.

Choose a strong signature algorithm like RS256 and store your secret keys securely.

Your APIs will be safer and faster with proper JWT authentication!




JSON Web Token (JWT) is quite popular and used for #authentication🔥

✍🏻 It's a token-based standard that allows us to securely transfer information between two parties without storing anything in a database.

JWT token consists of three parts:
✔️ Header
✔️ Payload
✔️ Signature
Each one being BaseURL64 encoded to form the token.

1) Client (Browser) 👉 sends post request with credentials to auth server to authenticate themselves

2) Auth Server 👉 authenticates user credential and generates a JWT. Server does not store anything and sends the token to the browser to save. It allows users to authenticate without their credentials in the future. It's best advised to store the token in an http only cookie.

3) Thereafter 👉 for every request the client sends the JWT in the authorization header. Validation happens using token introspection with the auth server.

4) Once validated, resource server 👉 sends the necessary data to the client.
