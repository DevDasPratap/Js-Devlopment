main backend ->  pubsub -> backend 1 (notification)
                        -> backend 2 (analytic)
                        -> backend 3 (email service)
            -> websocket -> backend 4
            -> http -> backend 5
            -> messageQ -> backend 6
                        -> backend 7

main backend handle core business logic (like bank transaction through upi/paytm must be update amount immedieately -/+ amount update to db)
other backend like send notification asynchronusly dely acceptable


sysnc (strong coupling) => http(rest/graphql)/websocket(debatable if ssync or async)
when you waiting for a response from another service is call sysnc (do it right now)

async (weak coupling) => message queue
                      => pub subs
                      => sever sent event
                      => websocket 
when you dont waiting for a response from another service is call async just push into queue you no need to wait for ackowledgement for service
you do your won things


websocket (tcp)
