Sql is a tradional RDMS
nosql is a document oriented nosql database

in sql, data is stored in tables with rows and columns
in monodb data stored in collection of json like documents

sql uses a fixed schema, where the structure of the tables must be defined before can be inserted
mongodb uses a dynamic schema where documents can have diffrent fields.

Here's a basic comparison between MySQL and MongoDB:

| Aspect           | MySQL                               | MongoDB                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data Model       | Relational: Tables with rows and columns | NoSQL: Documents in collections     |
| Schema           | Structured with predefined schema   | Flexible schema (schema-less)       |
| Query Language   | SQL (Structured Query Language)     | MongoDB Query Language (MQL)        |
| ACID Compliance  | Fully compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Limited (atomic operations)         |
| Scalability      | Vertical scaling (limited)          | Horizontal scaling (sharding)       |
| Use Cases        | Traditional transactional systems, e-commerce platforms | Content management, real-time analytics |
| Transactions     | Supports ACID transactions          | Limited atomic operations           |
| Performance      | Slower for read-heavy workloads     | Faster for read-heavy workloads     |
