Challenges of RDBMS

● What is NoSQL ?
  NoSQL doesn't imply being against or replacing SQL, as it may seem, but
  rather extends SQL or encompasses more than just SQL.
  NoSQL supplements RDBMS.
● Why NoSQL ?
  - Natively scalable
    It is based on the theory of distributed systems
  - Flexible schema
    NoSQL offers multiple types of databases based on the type of use :
          ● Key value
          ● Document based
          ● Columnar
          ● Graph
