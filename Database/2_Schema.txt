A database schema is a formal language description of the structure of a database, including how data is organized and stored, and the relationships between tables. It's also known as the "blueprint" of a database. 

SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

Structure
SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases can be document-oriented, key-value pairs, or graph structures.
In a NoSQL database, a document can contain key value pairs, which can then be ordered and nested.

Scalability
SQL databases scale vertically, usually on a single server, and require users to increase physical hardware to increase their storage capacities. In effect, while cloud-storage options are available, SQL databases can be prohibitively expensive for businesses when dealing with vast amounts of big data.

NoSQL databases offer horizontal scalability, meaning that more servers simply need to be added to increase their data load. This means that NoSQL databases are better for modern cloud-based infrastructures, which offer distributed resources.
