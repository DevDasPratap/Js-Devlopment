Types of Normalization

Normal Forms In DBMS: 
    - First Normal Form (1NF)
    - Second Normal Form (2NF)
    - Third  Normal Form (2NF)
    - Boyce- codd Normal Form (BCNF)


First Normal Form (1NF) requires that a table meet two conditions:
1. Each cell in the table must contain a single, atomic value.
2. There must be a primary key that uniquely identifies each row in the table.

In summary, for a table to be in 1NF, it must have atomic values in each cell and a primary key to uniquely identify each row.
