Normal Forms In DBMS: 
    - First Normal Form (1NF)
    - Second Normal Form (2NF)
    - Third  Normal Form (2NF)
    - Boyce- codd Normal Form (BCNF)


First Normal Form (1NF):
    - if one otable 2 condition satify
          - No cell in the table with multiple values
          - They should be a primary key
For a table to be in 1NF:
All cells should have single/atomic values and no multiple values
There has to be a primary key that uniquely identifies each row.
