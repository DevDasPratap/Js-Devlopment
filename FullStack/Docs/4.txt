#Variables
We know variable means variable. Beginners have a problem where to take variables and where not to take them. There are some tricks for this. Before that we need to know what is the function of the variable? Simply put, variables help us make anything dynamic. That's the only job. Apart from this, the variable has no other function. It is more like a container. The larger the container, the more space it will take. It means more memory is needed. So what is the need for extra memory? It is possible to take variables less. Then our application will be much lighter. But still we have to take variables. As if we will drink water. How will this water come to us? First, the water from below the ground is stored in a tank under the house through pipes and pumps. Then through another pump it goes on the roof and is stored in another tank. From there it is distributed from house to house through piping. We store that water in the filter through the tap at home. After filtering, we take that water in a jug or bottle. Then when we need to drink water, we drink water from a jug or bottle into a glass. Our purpose is to drink water, so it is necessary to store water in the middle? If we could not keep the tank, it would not be possible to distribute it to everyone's house. If I didn't put it in the filter, I couldn't purify the water. So variables are also like that. They store data. If we don't take the variable then we can't use the data a second time.
console.log('Pratap Das', 'Pratap Das'.length); // Pratap Das 10
In the above example if we want to do it with any other name then it is not possible. To do that, you have to drop the current name. Because in case of static code nothing can be changed at runtime. Now the question may come runtime and compile time?

console.log('Pratap Das', 'Pratap Das'.length); // Pratap Das 10
throw new Error('Something wrong'); // Error

There is nothing wrong with the program here. But while running the program it shows an error. This is called runtime error. The time during which the program runs is called runtime.

console.log('Pratap Das', 'Pratap Das'.length); // Pratap Das 10
1644dsfsdf

In this case the first code will not execute. will show error directly. Means he got error in code while compiling. This is called a compile time error.

Now we can change many things dynamically at runtime. Like can give some input, can fetch something from internet, can click with mouse. All this happens at runtime. But when we work with static data like in the first example, we cannot change the data inside the log in any way. For that we need to take variables. Whenever we look at the data we will take a variable.

let name = 'Pratap Das';
console.log(name, name.length); // Pratap Das 10






# Conditions
if (studyBasic) {
	wontJoin();
}

if (studyAdvanced) {
	join();
}

if (teacherSpeaks) {
	silent();
}

if (!teacherSpeaks) {
	shout();
}

// Scenario 1 - Single branch
// if condition
if (hasMoney) {
	buyPhone();
}

// Scenario 2 - Two branches
// if else condition
if (toss === 'head') {
	win();
} else {
	loss();
}

// Scenario 3 - Multiple branches
// else if
if (1 > 1) {
	big();
} else if (1 < 1) {
	small();
} else {
	same();
}

#Loops
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
	// it's a new js file,
	// we can write any valid js code here
	// every code written inside this block will execute multiple times
	console.log('Hello world!', i);
}

// There are total three types of loop available in JS
// 1. for (When we know the range)
// 1.1 Range
// 1.2 for in
// 1.3 for of
// 2. while (When we don't know the range)
// 3. do while *

while (true) {
	let num = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100);
	console.log('Hello World', num);
	if (num === 99) break;
}

do {
	console.log('It will run at least once');
} while (false);


Array

What type of data can we store in array? Almost all programming languages ​​have some limitations to storing data in arrays. And only one data type can be stored in an array. In this respect JavaScript has given complete freedom. Any data type can be stored in JavaScript. Even data of different data types can be stored in an array. We can understand if we look down a little.

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const bools = [true, true, false, false];
const nulls = [null, null, null];
const undefineds = [undefined, undefined, undefined];
const arrayOfArray = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
];
const mixed = [true, null, 'Str', 5, [12, 2, 4]];

Objects and functions can also be stored in arrays. Since we haven't discussed objects and functions yet, we haven't shown them here. An array can store data of different data types, but we will store only data of the same data type in an array. The reason is suppose you created an array of student names. Now if you put their address, phone number there then it will be difficult to find the name. So data of the same type should be stored in an array.

We can think of an array as a database. In memory database. Where we can create data, read it, update it if necessary and delete it if we want. This whole operation is called CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete operation. CRUD is the function of all the data structures in the world.

Object

In the array we have entered the names of some students. But now if we want to store information like their email, age and whether they are present in current class then there is a problem with array. We try to see what the problem is.

const student = ['Abu', 'Pratap', 'rayhan@example.com', 25, true];
sendEMail(students[0]);

function sendEmail(email) {
	console.log('Sending Email to ', email);
}


Now we see what could be the problem here. At first glance there is no way to tell which is which type of information. It means that the code has no readability. When we go to email someone, we need to remember how many numbers index that information. Now, here are 5 data that can be remembered somehow. If it is 5000 then it will be very difficult to remember. To overcome this problem we try to write it differently.

const student = {
	firstName: 'Pratap',
	secondName: 'Das',
	email: 'pratap@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
};

sendEMail(students.email);

function sendEmail(email) {
	console.log('Sending Email to ', email);
}

Even if some texts are written more, the code can be easily read to understand which information is which. Now I don't need to remember the index anymore. Just put a dot (.) at the end of the variable name. It is much more readable, much more informative than before.

Now we can store the information of many students in an array if we want. how can i let's see

const student1 = {
	firstName: 'Pratap',
	secondName: 'Das',
	email: 'pratap@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
};

const student2 = {
	firstName: 'PD',
	secondName: 'Dev',
	email: 'pd@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
};

const student3 = {
	firstName: 'Anu',
	secondName: 'Das',
	email: 'anu@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
};

const allStudents = [student1, student2, student3];

for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
	sendEmail(allStudents[i].email);
}

function sendEmail(email) {
	console.log('Sending email to', email);
}

Functions

The function we make works a lot like a loop. We use loops to do the same thing over and over again. We will also use functions to do the same thing over and over again. So why do we use functions to have loops?

Functions we can use in different places as we like. I can call the function as I like. We can reuse functions because functions have a name. But the loop has no name. So I can't use the loop wherever I want. If the loop starts again, I need to either break it, or let it continue until the loop ends. We have no control over the loop. But we can use the function in different places according to our needs. We can control according to our needs. If I take a few lines from the previous example

for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
	// sendEmail(allStudents[i].email);
	console.log('Sending email to', allStudents[i].email);
}

// function sendEmail(email) {
// 	console.log('Sending email to', email);
// }

We could do the same thing without writing functions. But the line inside the loop will not work anywhere outside the loop. But functions can be called anywhere.

When to use function and loop when? Functions when we do the same work in two different places. And if in one place then loop. For example if we are sending an email, and we need the full name in the email, we can do this with a loop. But if we send email in one place, and in other place need full name to create student list then loop will not work. We need to use the function It will be very difficult to understand at first. If you practice slowly, it will get stuck in your head.


Expression vs Statement

const name1 = 'Pratap'; // Statement
const name2 = 'Alvi'; // Statement
const name3 = 'Anik'; // Statement
const name4 = 'Arjun'; // Statement
const name5 = 'PD'; // Statement

const students = [
	'Pratap',
	'Alvi',
	'Anik',
	'Arjun',
	'PD',
	'Dev',
	'Bidyut',
]; // Statement

console.log(students[0]); // Expression
console.log(students[1]); // Expression
console.log(students[2]); // Expression
console.log(students[3]); // Expression
console.log(students[4]); // Expression

for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
	console.log(students[i], students[i].toLowerCase()); // Expression
} // Statement

name1.sendEmail(); // Expression
name2.sendEmail(); // Expression
name3.sendEmail(); // Expression
name4.sendEmail(); // Expression
name5.sendEmail(); // Expression

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // Statement
const bools = [true, true, false, false]; // Statement
const nulls = [null, null, null]; // Statement
const undefineds = [undefined, undefined, undefined]; // Statement
const arrayOfArray = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
]; // Statement
const mixed = [true, null, 'Str', 5, [12, 2, 4]]; // Statement

const student1 = {
	firstName: 'Das',
	secondName: 'Pratap',
	email: 'pratap@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
}; // Statement

const student2 = {
	firstName: 'Alvi',
	secondName: 'Dev',
	email: 'alvi@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
}; // Statement

const student3 = {
	firstName: 'arjun',
	secondName: 'na',
	email: 'arjun@example.com',
	age: 25,
	attend: true,
}; // Statement

const allStudents = [student1, student2, student3]; // Statement

for (let i = 0; i < allStudents.length; i++) {
	sendMail(allStudents[i].email); // Expression
} // Statement

function sendMail(email) {
	console.log('Sending email to', email);
} // Statement

allStudents.forEach((item) => console.log('Email ', item.email)); // Expression
allStudents.forEach((item) =>
	console.log('Full Name ', item.firstName, item.secondName)
); // Expression

function nameOfFunction(name) {
	if (!name) {
		console.log('Please provide your name');
	} else {
		console.log('Hello', name);
	}
} // Statement

nameOfFunction('Pratap'); // Expression
nameOfFunction('Das'); // Expression
nameOfFunction(); // Expression

function generateRandomNumber(min = 1, max) {
	const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * min + (max - min)); // Statement
	return randomNumber; // Expression
} // Statement

console.log(generateRandomNumber(5, 10)); // Expression

The basic difference between Expression and Statement is that Expression returns something at the end of the day, produces data, and stores it somewhere. As such function call is a type of expression. And the statement does not produce any data, cannot be stored anywhere, does not return anything. Function writing is statement, and function call is expression. Because writing function doesn't return anything until it is called. Again if the arrow function is written as an expression it is being stored in a variable.

Where to use the array and where the object?
Where the terms are singular we will use object. Where Plural we will use Array. For example, one phone - object, many phones - array, person - object, people - array, member - object, members - array. Objects where information about someone or something. Where there are more than one person or more than one object, we will use array. Just keep this in mind. Don't confuse arrays with objects in life anymore.


When to Use Arrays vs. Objects

Objects: Use an object when you are dealing with a single entity that contains various properties. Objects are suitable for representing singular items. Each property of an object holds a value, which can be of any data type (including another object or array).

Example:

javascript
Copy code
const phone = {
  brand: "Apple",
  model: "iPhone 13",
  price: 999
};

const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Engineer"
};
Arrays: Use an array when you are dealing with a collection of items. Arrays are suitable for representing multiple entities of the same type. Each element in an array is usually an object or a primitive value, and the array itself maintains the order of these elements.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
const phones = [
  { brand: "Apple", model: "iPhone 13", price: 999 },
  { brand: "Samsung", model: "Galaxy S21", price: 799 },
  { brand: "Google", model: "Pixel 6", price: 599 }
];

const people = [
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, occupation: "Engineer" },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 25, occupation: "Designer" },
  { name: "Alice Johnson", age: 28, occupation: "Doctor" }
];
Key Points to Remember:
Singular vs. Plural:

Singular term → Use an object.
Plural term → Use an array.
Use Case:

For storing information about a single item, use an object.
For storing information about multiple items, use an array.
Example Scenarios:

Object: A single phone, a single person.
Array: A list of phones, a list of people.
By keeping these guidelines in mind, you can more effectively organize and manage your data structures, avoiding confusion between arrays and objects in your programming endeavors.
