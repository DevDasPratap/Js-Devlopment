JavaScript Array and Object Deep Dive

Declerative: map, filter, reduce, some, find etc
Imperative: for loop, while loop etc

for in loop => retrun index array, return key Object
for of loop => return value array, 

mutable vs emutable
reference error
imperative vs declarative
reference
garbage

map = same length as the original array
filter = with filter item
reduce = know one know (only you know), all posible value like string, array, Object
