// What is the node.js module wrapper function?
// Node.js will wrap a module's code with a wrapper function before it is executed. The wrapper function looks like the following:

// Code:

(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Module code
});

// The variables and functions in the node.js are private to the module that has it. The variables and functions inside the module are private and not visible to the outside. The variables and functions are made private in node.js using the node.js module wrapper function.
